All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome. It's how we stay on the same page about our policies. And it's how we tell others everything they need in order to be able to use this project -- or contribute to it. So thank you in advance.

Documentation contributions of any size are welcome! Feel free to file a PR even if you're just rewording a sentence to be more clear, or fixing a spelling mistake!

If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that lightly. ðŸ’š
If your PR gets accepted, it will be marked as such, and merged into the latest branch soon after. Your contribution will be distributed to the next time the maintainers tag a release.
