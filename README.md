Read About Me, A Full Stack Dev

👋 Originally from Brazil, Bahia.
💬 Began coding in 2019, quickly fell in love and had a burning desire to create amazing web applications to expand the technologies we use.
🔭 Innovation is always on my mind, Paypal started as a 'super-bank' but the consumers of the service had a different idea, they just loved the ability to email money!
⚡ I aspire to come across the next innovative stepping stone in this world, and aspire to work with a company to help!
